h1. How are you gentlemen _!!_

This module provides an easy way to debug broken code.

h2. What you say _!!_

bc. from great_justice import what_happen
try:
    # ...
except:
    what_happen()

Or make it even better:

bc. from great_justice import take_your_time
with take_your_time():
    # ...

Results:

bc. 一体どうしたと言んだ！
File "test.py", line 12, in <module>
  do_test()
    do_test = <function do_test at 0x7f8d1dc538c0>
File "test.py", line 9, in do_test
  foo = bar + baz
    foo = 1
    baz = 'test'
NameError: global name 'bar' is not defined

To get a nice debug log just pass a logger object:

bc. from great_justice import what_happen
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
try:
    # ...
except:
    what_happen(logger=logger)
